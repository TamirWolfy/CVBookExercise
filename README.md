# CVBookExercise
My attempted answers to the exercises from "Programming Computer Vision with Python" by Jan Erik Solem


Although I have tried my best, these answers may not be correct. Also, they are not optimal either. So, don't use them as answers to check against.


As I was not able to find examples to these exercises anywhere, I thought it may be a good idea to share my answers, even though it is not perfect. That's all.


The scripts require external modules, which are explained in the book. Please download them from the [support page of the book]
(http://programmingcomputervision.com/)


Some codes need test data not described in the book. So, I downloaded them from here and there. As these files belong to someone else, I did not include those files in this repository. Please download them from the URL described in each file.
