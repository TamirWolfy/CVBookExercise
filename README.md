# CVBookExercise
My attempted answers to the exercises from "Programming Computer Vision with Python" by Jan Erik Solem


As I was not able to find examples to these exercises anywhere while reading through the book, I thought it may be a good idea to share my answers, even though it is not perfect. That's all. (If it is actually a not good idea for any reason, please let me know. I will try to fix it.)


Although I have tried my best, these answers may not be correct. Also, they are not optimal either. So, don't use them as answers to check against. Remember, it is done by someone who's just trying to learn this topic.


The scripts require external modules, which are explained in the book. Please download them from [the support page of the link](http://programmingcomputervision.com/)


Some codes need test data not described in the book. So, I downloaded them from here and there. As these files belong to someone else, I did not include those files in this repository. Please download them from the URL described in each file.
